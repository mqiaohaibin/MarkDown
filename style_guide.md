## Document layout

In general, most documents benefit from some variation fo the following layout:

```
# Document Title

Short introduction.

## Topic

Content.

## See also

* https://link-to-more-info
```

1. `# Document Title`: The first heading should be a level one heading, and should ideally be the same or nearly the same as the filename.
2. `author`: Optional. If you'd like to claim ownership of the document or if you are very pround of it, add yourself under the title.
3. `Short introduction.`: 1-3 sentences providing a high-level overview of the topic. 
4. `## Topic`: The rest of your headings should start from level 2.
5. `## See also`: Put miscellaneous links at the bottom for the user who wants to know more or didn't find what she needed. 

## Headings

1. ATX-style headings.
2. Add spacing to headings and newlines before and after.

## Lists

1. Use lazy numbering for long lists.
2. When nesting lists, use a 4 space indent for both numbered and bulleted lists.

## Code

1.	Use inline code for short code quotations and field names.
2.	For code quotations longer than a single line, use code block.
3.	It is best practice to explicitly declare the language, so that neither the syntax highlighter nor the next editor must guess.
4.	Indented code blocks are sometimes cleaner.

## Links

1. Long links make source Markdown difficult to read and break the 80 character wrapping.
2. Use informative Markdown link titles.

## Images

Use images sparingly, and prefer simple screen shots.

## Miscellaneous

1. Prefer lists to tables.
2. Prefer Markdown to HTML
